# The project is based on 'Detectron' library, and this repo is forked from original [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) repo 

In order to reproduce the results, you will need to install Caffe2 and Detectron. The instruction can be found in Detectron repo. You can also consult my docs ([Caffe2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18dUvJUz7bGeaD5fKzSbhCj37QFNoklR8-hgX3Z5_xVA/edit?usp=sharing), [Detectron](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XGjWH1H3u340TG-uQy4dKNRCtGACTIzcCfct9XRzbOo/edit?usp=sharing)). Although they may be outdated since Caffe2 is now part of Pytorch. You can always contact me at cw234@iu.edu for any questions regarding installing and configuration.
